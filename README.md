# Hangman-Game
This is a game of hangman, which I made to practice the concepts that I am learning from the class INSY 341 (Developing Business Apps).

Instructions: Open index.html. Click the button "Generate word" and then click the button "Make a guess" to guess a character in the word. If you get too many letters wrong, you lose, but if you figure out the word, you win! 
Hint: All the words are related to HTML, CSS or JavaScript.
